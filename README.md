# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation

## 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis  
**Project by Krishna Baraskar**

### 🔍 About the Project  
This project helped me understand why some hotel bookings get canceled and what kind of guests are more likely to cancel. I worked with real data from two types of hotels — a city hotel and a resort hotel. The goal was to find patterns behind cancellations so that hotel managers can reduce revenue loss and plan better.

### 🧠 What I Did  
- Loaded and cleaned the data using **Python and Pandas**
- Converted text-based dates into real date formats  
- Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values  
- Explored important features like:
  - **Lead time** (how early someone booked)
  - **Special requests**
  - **Deposit type**
  - **Customer type**  
- Created charts and graphs using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to make the analysis visual and easy to understand

---

### 📈 What I Discovered  
- Bookings made **far in advance** were more likely to be canceled  
- Customers who made **no special requests** were more likely to cancel  
- **City hotels** had a higher cancellation rate than resort hotels  
- Most cancellations were from **individual travelers**, not corporate clients

---

### 💡 What This Means  
Hotels can use these insights to:
- Predict which bookings might be risky  
- Offer non-refundable discounts for long lead-time bookings  
- Improve customer retention with better services or flexible policies

### 🛠️ Tools I Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

### 👨‍💻 What I Learned  
This project improved my skills in:
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Creating visual insights  
- Thinking from a **business perspective**, not just a technical one

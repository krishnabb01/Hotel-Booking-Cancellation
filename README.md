# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
By applying the pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib libraries, I conducted advanced statistical
 analysis on hotel booking data to pinpoint the primary reasons impacting cancellations.
 This led to the creation of customized booking policies that will increase revenue and
 boost customer loyalty.
 Hotel-Booking-Cancellation analysis involves studying patterns and reasons behind cancellations of hotel bookings made by guests. 
 This examination encompasses factors such as booking lead time, seasonality, pricing, and customer behavior to identify trends and insights. 
 By understanding the drivers of cancellations, hotels can optimize revenue management strategies, 
 refine booking policies, and enhance customer satisfaction by minimizing friction in the cancellation process and improving retention efforts.
